# Dynamic Wallpaper thing.

WARNING: Very much Work in progress.

## Requirements:
 
 `feh` is required, otherwise vanilla python script.
 
## Usage:

  `python src/dynopaper/__init__.py` to set wallpaper for current time.
  
  `python src/dynopaper/__init__.py 07:00` to set wallpaper for 7 AM. Or any other time for that matter.
  
  Optionally it is possible to specify Latitude and Longitude via `--lat` and `--lng` parameters.
  
  It is possible to print local timing as well with `--print-timing` parameter.
  
  `python src/dynopaper/__init__.py --print-timing`
